1. TO FIND THE (N+1)TH FIBONACCI NUMBER WITH TIME COMPLEXITY O(LOGN), WE MUST MULTIPLY THE MATRIX {{1,1},{1,0}} BY ITSELF FOR N TIMES AND THEN PRINT THE (0,0) POSITION OF THE MATRIX.
2. TO CALCULATE a^(b^c) for very large numbers, we will calculate b^c%(M-1), then with this value, we will calculate (a^value)%M.
